## 🎯 Feature 1: AI Auto-Detection

### What It Does
Analyzes YouTube videos to automatically find the most engaging/replayed segment.

### How It Works
```
User provides YouTube URL
    ↓
AI analyzes video metadata
    ↓
Checks for:
- Most replayed segments (heatmap data)
- Chapter information
- Video engagement patterns
    ↓
Selects optimal 30-60 second segment
    ↓
Generates title & hashtags for that segment
```

### Detection Methods (in priority order)

**1. Heatmap Analysis (Highest Confidence)**
- Uses YouTube's "most replayed" data
- Finds peak engagement points
- Centers 30-60 second clip on peak
- Example: "Most replayed segment detected at 2:45"

**2. Chapter Analysis (Medium Confidence)**
- Analyzes chapter titles for keywords
- Looks for: "highlight", "best", "tutorial", "tip", "trick"
- Selects most interesting chapter
- Example: "Selected chapter: Amazing Trick Revealed"

**3. Smart Default (Low-Medium Confidence)**
- Skips first 10% (intro)
- Takes 45-second segment
- Optimal for videos without heatmap/chapters
- Example: "Selected segment after intro with optimal length"

### Usage

**Option 1: Auto-Detect Only**
1. Paste YouTube URL
2. Check "🤖 AI Auto-Detect Best Segment"
3. Leave time fields blank
4. Click "Generate Short"

**Option 2: Auto-Detect with Manual Override**
1. Paste YouTube URL
2. Check "🤖 AI Auto-Detect"
3. Optionally enter times (will use AI if blank)
4. Click "Generate Short"

**Option 3: Manual Mode**
1. Paste YouTube URL
2. Leave "AI Auto-Detect" unchecked
3. Enter start and end times
4. Click "Generate Short"

## 🔄 Feature 2: Smart Rotation

### What It Does
Intelligently rotates landscape videos to better fit 9:16 vertical format.

### How It Works

**Before (Old Method):**
```
Landscape video (16:9)
    ↓
Scale to fit 9:16
    ↓
Large black bars on top/bottom
```

**After (Smart Rotation):**
```
Landscape video (16:9)
    ↓
Check if rotation would improve fit
    ↓
If yes: Rotate 90° clockwise
    ↓
Scale to fill 9:16 frame
    ↓
Minimal black bars
```

### Benefits
- **Better frame coverage** - Less wasted space
- **More content visible** - Fills vertical screen
- **Professional look** - Optimized for mobile viewing
- **No cropping** - Preserves all content

### Technical Details
```python
# Smart rotation algorithm
1. Calculate current aspect ratio
2. Calculate target ratio (9:16)
3. Calculate rotated ratio
4. Compare which is closer to target
5. Rotate if it improves fit
6. Scale to maximize coverage
7. Center with minimal black bars
```

## 💬 Feature 3: AI Error Explanations

### What It Does
Provides clear, human-readable error messages with AI-generated solutions.

### Error Format

**Console Output:**
```
================================================================================

📝 Message: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'video.mp4'

📍 Context: Video processing

🤖 AI Explanation:
   The system could not locate the input video file at the specified path.
   This usually happens when the download failed or the file was moved.
   Try downloading the video again or check your internet connection.

================================================================================
```

**User-Friendly Message (UI):**
```
❌ FileNotFoundError: The system could not locate the input video file.
Check if the video URL is valid and accessible. Try downloading again.
```

### Supported Error Types

| Error Type | AI Explanation Includes |
|------------|------------------------|
| FileNotFoundError | File location, path validation |
| PermissionError | Permission issues, how to fix |
| ConnectionError | Network troubleshooting |
| ValueError | Input format correction |
| TimeoutError | Speed/retry suggestions |
| ImportError | Package installation commands |

### Usage in Code

```python
from ai_error_handler import handle_error, get_error_message

try:
    # Your code here
    process_video(url)
except Exception as e:
    # Console output with full details
    handle_error(e, context="Video processing", show_traceback=True)
    
    # User-friendly message for UI
    user_msg = get_error_message(e, context="Video processing")
    messages.error(request, user_msg)
```

## 🧹 Feature 4: Auto Cleanup

### What It Does
Automatically deletes all temporary files after successful upload to save disk space.

### Cleanup Stages

**Stage 1: During Processing**
```
After video generation:
- Delete downloaded source video
- Keep generated short
- Delete temp audio files
```

**Stage 2: After Upload**
```
After successful YouTube upload:
- Delete generated short
- Delete all downloads
- Delete temp files
- Clean output directory
```

### Files Cleaned

✅ Downloaded videos (`downloads/`)
✅ Generated shorts (`outputs/`)
✅ Temporary audio files (`temp-audio.m4a`)
✅ Processing artifacts

### Manual Cleanup

```python
from video_processor import VideoProcessor

processor = VideoProcessor()

# Clean downloads only
processor.cleanup(keep_outputs=True)

# Clean everything
processor.cleanup(keep_outputs=False, cleanup_all=True)

# Post-upload cleanup
processor.cleanup_after_upload(video_path='path/to/video.mp4')
```

### Console Output

```
🧹 Starting post-upload cleanup...
✅ Deleted uploaded video: short_1.mp4
🧹 Cleaned 1 downloaded file(s)
🧹 Cleaned 1 output file(s)
✅ Post-upload cleanup complete!
```

AUTO_CLEANUP_AFTER_UPLOAD = True

# Smart rotation
ENABLE_SMART_ROTATION = True
```

### API Requirements

**Required for AI Features:**
- Gemini API Key (for auto-detection, metadata, error explanations)

**Works Without API:**
- Manual time selection
- Basic error messages
- Standard metadata
- Video processing

**After Auto-Cleanup:**
- All files deleted
- **Total: 0 MB** (only database record remains)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### AI Auto-Detection Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Falls back to manual mode
- Error message about auto-detection

**Solutions:**
1. Check Gemini API key is set
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try a different video (some have no heatmap data)
4. Use manual mode as fallback

### Smart Rotation Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Video appears sideways
- Black bars too large

**Solutions:**
1. Check source video orientation
2. Disable smart rotation (use scale only)
3. Use vertical source videos for best results

### Cleanup Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Files not deleted
- Permission errors

**Solutions:**
1. Close any programs using the files
2. Check file permissions
3. Run as administrator (Windows)
4. Manual cleanup: delete `downloads/` and `outputs/` folders

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Best Auto-Detection Results

1. **Use popular videos** - More likely to have heatmap data
2. **Longer videos** - More segments to choose from
3. **Well-structured videos** - With chapters and clear sections
4. **High-engagement videos** - Better heatmap data

### For Best Rotation Results

1. **Landscape source videos** - Benefit most from rotation
2. **Clear subject** - Centered content works best
3. **Minimal text** - Text may rotate awkwardly
4. **Test both modes** - Compare auto vs manual

### For Optimal Performance

1. **Enable auto-cleanup** - Saves disk space
2. **Use AI sparingly** - For important shorts
3. **Monitor API quotas** - Gemini has rate limits
4. **Batch process** - Multiple shorts at once
