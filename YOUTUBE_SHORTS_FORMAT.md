## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Video not appearing in Shorts feed"
- Wait 1-2 hours for processing
- Check #Shorts is in description
- Verify video is 9:16 format
- Ensure duration is ≤60 seconds

### "Copyright claim on Short"
- Shorts have different rules than videos
- Claims are usually monetization, not takedowns
- Dispute if you believe it's fair use
- Try shorter clips from videos

### "Video appears as regular video, not Short"
- Check resolution is 1080x1920
- Verify #Shorts tag is present
- Re-upload if needed
- May take time to process

### "Black bars too large"
