# ‚úÖ OAuth Error Fixed!

## What Was the Problem?

**Error:** `OAuth 2 MUST utilize https`

**Cause:** Google's OAuth library requires HTTPS by default for security. However, we're running on `http://localhost:8000` for local development.

**Solution:** Added `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT = '1'` environment variable to allow HTTP during local development.

---

## What Changed?

Updated `shorts/youtube_uploader.py` to allow insecure transport (HTTP) for local development:

```python
# At the top of the file
os.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'] = '1'
```

This tells the OAuth library: "It's okay to use HTTP instead of HTTPS for local testing."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note

**This is ONLY for local development!**

When deploying to production:
1. Remove or disable `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT`
2. Use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
3. Update redirect URIs to use `https://` instead of `http://`

## üéØ Next Steps - Test the Upload!

Now that the OAuth error is fixed, restart your server and test:

### 1. Restart the Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then restart:
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Generate a Short
- Go to http://localhost:8000
- Paste a YouTube URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw`)
- Start time: `0:05`
- End time: `0:35`
- Click "Generate Short"

### 3. Upload to YouTube
- After the short is generated, click "Upload to YouTube"
- You'll be redirected to Google login
- Sign in with your YouTube account
- Grant permissions when asked
- You'll be redirected back to the app
- **Video uploads automatically!** üöÄ

### 4. Verify Upload
- Check your YouTube Studio: https://studio.youtube.com
- Your short should appear in the videos list
- The AI-generated title and hashtags will be applied

## üêõ If You Still See Errors

### "Redirect URI mismatch"
- Check Google Cloud Console
- Redirect URI must be exactly: `http://localhost:8000/oauth2callback/`
- No extra slashes or characters

### "Access blocked"
- Add yourself as a test user in OAuth consent screen
- Go to: Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen ‚Üí Test users

### "Invalid credentials"
- Check `client_secret.json` is in project root
- Verify the file format is correct
- Restart the server

### "Quota exceeded"
- You've hit the daily limit (10,000 units)
- Each upload = 1,600 units (~6 uploads/day)
- Wait until midnight Pacific Time for reset

---

## üìä What Happens During Upload

1. **Click "Upload to YouTube"**
   - App checks for OAuth credentials
   - No credentials? ‚Üí Redirects to Google

2. **Google Authentication**
   - You sign in with your Google account
   - Google shows permission request
   - You click "Allow"

3. **OAuth Callback**
   - Google redirects back with authorization code
   - App exchanges code for access token
   - Token saved in session (stays valid)

4. **Video Upload**
   - App uses token to call YouTube API
   - Uploads video with AI-generated metadata
   - Returns YouTube video ID

5. **Success!**
   - Video appears in your YouTube Studio
   - You can view it on YouTube
   - Future uploads won't need re-authentication

## üéì Understanding the Fix

### Why HTTP for Local Development?

**Development:**
- Running on `localhost` (your computer)
- No SSL certificate needed
- HTTP is fine for testing
- `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT = '1'` allows this

**Production:**
- Running on a public domain
- MUST use HTTPS
- SSL certificate required
- Remove the insecure transport flag
