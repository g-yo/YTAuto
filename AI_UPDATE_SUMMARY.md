## 🎓 Technical Details

### AI Auto-Detection Algorithm

```python
1. Fetch video metadata from YouTube
2. Check for heatmap data (most replayed)
   - If available: Use peak engagement point
   - Confidence: HIGH
3. If no heatmap, check chapters
   - Analyze titles for keywords
   - Select most interesting chapter
   - Confidence: MEDIUM
4. If no chapters, use smart default
   - Skip first 10% (intro)
   - Take 45-second segment
   - Confidence: LOW-MEDIUM
5. Generate AI metadata for selected segment
6. Return segment + metadata
```

### Smart Rotation Algorithm

```python
1. Get current video dimensions
2. Calculate current aspect ratio
3. Calculate target ratio (9:16)
4. Calculate rotated ratio (if rotated 90°)
5. Compare distances to target:
   - If rotated is closer: ROTATE
   - If current is closer: DON'T ROTATE
6. Scale to maximize frame coverage
7. Center with minimal black bars
8. Crop if extends beyond frame
```

### Auto Cleanup Process

```python
1. After video generation:
   - Delete downloaded source
   - Keep generated short
   - Delete temp audio files

2. After successful upload:
   - Delete uploaded video file
   - Delete all downloads
   - Delete all outputs
   - Clean temp files
   - Free disk space
```

## 🐛 Error Handling Examples

### Example 1: Network Error

**Console:**
```
================================================================================
❌ ERROR: ConnectionError
================================================================================

📝 Message: Failed to establish connection to youtube.com

📍 Context: Video download

🤖 AI Explanation:
   Could not connect to YouTube servers. This usually happens due to
   internet connectivity issues or YouTube being temporarily unavailable.
   Check your internet connection and try again in a few moments.

================================================================================
```

**UI:**
```
❌ ConnectionError: Could not connect to YouTube servers.
Check your internet connection and try again.
```

### Example 2: Invalid Time Format

**Console:**
```
================================================================================
❌ ERROR: ValueError
================================================================================

📝 Message: Invalid time format. Use 'MM:SS' or 'HH:MM:SS'

📍 Context: Time parsing

🤖 AI Explanation:
   The time format you entered is not recognized. Please use one of these
   formats: MM:SS (e.g., 1:30), HH:MM:SS (e.g., 0:01:30), or just seconds
   (e.g., 90). Make sure to include the colon separator.

================================================================================
